While in some people, the body\u2019s immune system generates antibodies against these foreign bodies or allergens. This causes inflammation and leads to various symptoms that can range from being mild to quite severe.The symptoms of allergy vary such as mild sneezing, runny nose, swelling of face, swelling of the tongue, skin rash, itching, and difficulty in breathing, etc. Anaphylaxis is a severe reaction to any type of allergy which can be life-threatening, if not promptly treated.Allergies are widely prevalent across the world. These can be caused due to different types of allergens such as dust, molds, mites, foods like nuts, fish, and medicines like penicillin.

It is characterized by disturbances in thinking skills, reasoning, language, and perception and, eventually, the ability to carry out simple daily tasks.The exact cause of Alzheimer's disease is not known. However, accumulation of amyloid proteins and tangled bundles of fibers called neurofibrillary, or tau tangles, in the brain are suspected to play a role.Alzheimer\u2019s disease is not a normal part of aging and is not something that inevitably happens in later life. However, the likelihood of having Alzheimer's disease increases substantially with advancing age. A combination of age-related brain changes, genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors are thought to increase the risk of this condition.Though AD is not entirely preventable, ensuring an extensive social network, and frequent participation in social, physical, and intellectually stimulating activities like reading, playing games, participating in adult education courses, and other recreational activities can delay its onset.Current Alzheimer's medications can help temporarily with memory symptoms and other cognitive changes. Caregivers play an extremely pivotal role in helping the patient with their daily needs and activities as well as protecting them from any danger.",

Primary amenorrhoea is when a woman never had menstrual periods, and in secondary amenorrhoea, there is the absence of menstrual periods in a woman who was previously menstruating.The causes of primary amenorrhea are defects in the ovaries, problems with the reproductive organs, and issues with the pituitary gland, and the central nervous system. Secondary amenorrhea can result from natural causes like pregnancy, and breastfeeding or other causes like low body weight, mental stress, excessive exercise, hormonal imbalance, and birth control pills.A variety of tests are necessary for the diagnosis of amenorrhoea including pregnancy, thyroid function test, ovary function test, male hormone test, and prolactin test. Treatment mainly depends on the cause of amenorrhea. If the cause of amenorrhea is a hormonal imbalance then hormone replacement therapy can be administered. If amenorrhea is due to malnutrition, a proper diet plan can cure the patient successfully. In some cases, surgery is required that can treat anatomical causes of amenorrhea.",

The thyroid produces two hormones that control metabolism and plays a vital role in puberty and menstruation. Both upregulation and downregulation of the thyroid gland can cause menstrual irregularities, including amenorrhea.', 'Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS):PCOS is a hormonal disorder common among women of reproductive age. PCOS may cause menstrual cycle changes, increased facial and body hair, cysts in the ovaries, and infertility. Most women with PCOS either have amenorrhea or experience irregular periods, called oligomenorrhea.', 'Hypothalamic amenorrhoea:This condition occurs when the hypothalamus, a gland in the brain that regulates body processes, slows or stops releasing gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). GnRH is the primary hormone for the starting of the menstrual cycle.', 'Low body weight:Women who perform extraneous exercise regularly or lose a significant amount of weight are at risk of developing Functional Hypothalamic Amenorrhoea (FHA). In such cases, women do not consume enough calories to maintain their normal menstrual cycles.', 'Hyperandrogenaemia:In this case, the body makes high levels of male sex hormones, which can affect the female reproductive system.

But, for some women, the ovarian supply of eggs diminishes before the age of 40 leading to early cessation of menstruation.', 'Birth control pills:Some birth control pills may cause missed periods or the complete absence of menstruation. A few injectable contraceptives and hormonal intrauterine devices (IUDs) can cause amenorrhea. After stopping the pills and injectables it takes a few months to restart a regular menstrual cycle.', 'Recreational drugs:The use of opiates (such as heroin) on a regular basis has also been known to cause amenorrhoea in longer term users.', 'Antipsychotic drugs:The drugs which are commonly used to treat schizophrenia, have been known to cause amenorrhoea as well. Research suggests that antipsychotic medications result in hormonal imbalance which can cause amenorrhea.', 'Radiation and chemotherapy:Certain cancer treatments like bone marrow, blood, lymph nodes, and breast can destroy estrogen-producing cells and eggs in the ovaries, leading to amenorrhea.']",

Millions of bacteria are present in the environment around us, on our body and inside it. Bacteria are both useful and harmful to us. Many are beneficial, such as those involved in immunity and digestion. In fact, only a small number of bacteria are responsible for illnesses.These harmful bacteria invade the body and multiply by challenging the body's natural defenses. They are transmitted through contact, droplets, vectors, airborne particles, or contaminated objects.Poor hand hygiene, weak immunity, chronic health conditions, and close contact with infected individuals can increase the risk of bacterial infections.Regular handwashing, getting vaccinated, and ensuring food safety are some of the ways to prevent bacterial infections.

Bell's palsy causes sudden weakness and paralysis of the muscles of the face over a period of 48- 72 hours. It is characterized by a droopy appearance of the face wherein the patient finds it difficult to move their mouth, raise their forehead and close their eye. The weakness may also affect saliva and tear production as well as the sense of taste.Bell's palsy usually affects only one side of the face; however, in rare cases, it can affect both sides. People in the age group of 15 to 45 years are usually affected, but the disease may occur at any age. Women and men are equally affected or a slight female predilection is seen. The exact cause of the condition is unknown, but it is usually known to be a reaction that occurs after a viral infection.Symptoms generally start to improve after a few weeks, with the recovery of some or all facial functions within six months. However, a prompt visit to the doctor and early treatment leads to a better outlook. It is also essential to rule out life-threatening conditions like stroke. Although most patients recover completely, some might have unfavorable functional and cosmetic outcomes due to chronic facial weakness. Relevant interventions and home care can help in improving the quality of life.",

It is a benign (non-cancerous) condition in which the prostate (a walnut-sized gland) enlarges in size. The prostate gland surrounds the urethra, a tube that carries urine and semen outside of the body. When the prostate gland enlarges, it can make the passage of urine and semen through the urethra a difficult process.\u00a0 This causes symptoms such as blocking urine outflow, frequent urge to urinate, difficulty in starting urination, dribbling at the end of urine flow,urinary tract infectionetc.In India, benign prostatic hyperplasia is a common elderly problem with an incidence rate of 92.97% and 93.3%. AUA guidelines suggested that BPH incidence worldwide will increase, and by the age of 60 years, more than 50% of men would have some evidence of the disease.There are several treatment options available for benign prostate hyperplasia. If you have been diagnosed with the condition, you might be prescribed medications such as finasteride and dutasteride. These medications have proven to be effective in treating BPH. Depending on your condition, your doctor may also advise different types of surgeries that can be used to remove the prostate tissue that is blocking the urinary flow.",

    "description about disease": "A cataract is an eye ailment in which the clear eye lens becomes opaque, obstructing light from passing through and causing a decrease in vision. For people with cataracts, gazing through foggy lenses is comparable to looking through a frosty or fogged-up window.The majority of cases affect older people, while occasionally, younger people might also be affected. Various factors can cause cataracts, such as smoking, ultraviolet radiation, certain diseases like diabetes, trauma, radiation therapy etc. Cataracts can seriously impede daily activities; if untreated, they might even result in blindness.Based on the severity of the medical condition, the doctor might ask you for prescription glasses or surgery if required. While prescription glasses cannot directly treat cataracts, they can aid in correcting blurry vision and other problems caused by cataracts.Surgery is performed when the visual loss due to a cataract severely impacts the patient's quality of life. Cataract surgery is usually safe and effective, significantly improving vision.",

It is also crucial for the maintenance of pregnancy in the uterus until the onset of labor.Cervical cancer is a type of cancer that occurs in the cells of the cervix. This cancer can affect the deeper tissues of the cervix and may spread to other parts of the body (metastasize), often the lungs, liver, bladder, vagina, and rectum.This cancer is the second most common female malignant (cancerous) tumor globally which seriously threatens female\u2019s health. Nearly all cervical cancers are caused by an infection with human papillomavirus (HPV).Some cases may not show any symptoms, but general symptoms include bleeding in between periods and after sexual intercourse.

Most colon cancers develop from polyps lining the colon. While the polyps are initially non-cancerous and harmless, over a period of time they can develop into cancer.Colon polyps and early cancer may have no cancer-specific early signs or symptoms. Therefore, regular colorectal cancer screening is important. Diagnosis of colon cancer is done by colonoscopy, which visualizes the entire colon along with biopsy, which confirms the cancerous tissue.The treatment and prognosis of colon cancer depends on the location, size, stage and extent of cancer spread, as well as the overall health of the patient. In early stages of colon cancer, the tumor is removed through surgery. If not treated at the right time, it can spread to other parts of the body, especially the lungs and liver. The treatment in advanced stages involves chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy and/or their combinations.",

Although there are many types of dementia, Alzheimer's disease associated dementia is the most common and accounts for 60-70% of all cases.There are numerous factors that can be behind dementia. These include but are not limited to poor blood supply, abnormal protein accumulation and degenerative changes in the brain. The condition may start with something as simple as not being able to remember important dates or events and may increase in severity where a person may forget to wear clothes or eat food on time.Being diagnosed with dementia can be a life-altering and challenging situation for the patient and his/her caregivers. Dementia is a progressive condition and can worsen with time. The treatments currently available are known to slow the progression of the disease, but cannot entirely stop it.",

Having an immediate family member suffering from the disease, early onset of menstruation and not having a child increase the risk of endometriosis. It usually affects women between the ages of 25 and 40. Women with endometriosis are more likely to have infertility or difficulty getting pregnant.Endometriosis can be diagnosed with abdominal ultrasound or laparoscopy, which is the gold standard of diagnosis and treatment. Treatment often begins with medications such as oral contraceptives, GnRH analogues and injections to suppress the ovarian function. Surgery is often the last resort to treat the later stages of this condition.You can take care of yourself at home by trying some simple remedies such as using a heating pad for pain relief and including remedies such as curcumin and green tea.

However, a small percentage of children (2.5% to 5%) who experience complex febrile seizures may have an increased risk of developing epilepsy later in life.Febrile seizures are classified into two types: simple and complex. Simple febrile seizures are short, lasting less than 15 minutes, and do not recur within 24 hours. In contrast, complex febrile seizures last longer, may occur multiple times within a day, and can include confusion after the episode.Managing fever during illness is key to preventing febrile seizures. This can be done by using fever-reducing medications like acetaminophen or ibuprofen, sponging, and ensuring the child stays well-hydrated.

The symptoms of food allergy include difficulty breathing, chest tightness, rashes (hives), and itching all over your body.Children between the age of 6-11 years are most commonly affected and the common risk factors include a family history of allergic reactions,asthma, and age of introduction to solid foods.The best way to prevent any allergic reaction is to avoid the food items that are causing it. In case of accidental exposure or emergency, adrenaline can be used. Antihistamines and bronchodilators may be used to provide relief from symptoms.Accurate diagnosis and successful management of allergies are essential to prevent any severe reactions in the future. An allergist or immunologist has specialized training and experience to diagnose the problem and develop a prevention plan.",

The most common symptoms include nasal secretions, chills, fever, and decreased appetite.Though anyone can get affected by it, the people at higher risk are individuals on the extreme spectrum of age like children below 5 years, or adults over 65 years of age. Also, individuals who have other health conditions like asthma, diabetes, or an autoimmune disorder, or pregnant women are at a greater risk.The best way to prevent infection is to maintain proper hand hygiene, avoid crowded areas during the outbreak, and get vaccinated. The treatment generally includes supportive measures like bed rest, intake of fluids, eating a healthy balanced diet, etc. Antiviral drugs may also be prescribed in some cases.",

    "description about disease": "Generally, people shed around 50 to 100 single hair per day. Hair shedding is a natural process in which some hair sheds while new hair start to grow in. Hair loss or alopecia occurs when this balance is disrupted and more hair begin to fall than the new hair growing.Hair loss affects men, women, and sometimes even children. One may notice hair loss in the form of hair thinning, receding hairline, part widening, and bald patches. Age, genetics, nutritional deficiencies, hormonal imbalances, certain diseases and medications could be some of the causes of hair fall. However stress, tight hairstyles, chemical hair treatments and overuse of styling products, are also known to trigger hair fall.Hair loss does not have any harmful physical effects as such, but its psychological impact cannot be denied. For most people, their hair is inherently connected to their confidence. If their hair looks good, they feel good about themselves. But if they start losing hair, their self esteem begins to dwindle. In such a case, one can try one or many treatment options available for dealing with hair loss.Home remedies and oral hair supplements are usually the first line of action for hair loss. However, it is always advisable to visit a dermatologist or trichologist to get a proper diagnosis and treatment. Various treatment options include topical agents like Minoxidil, injections, oral treatments, Platelet rich plasma (PRP) therapy and hair transplantation.",

If the blood flow to the heart is not restored quickly it can cause permanent damage to the muscles, leading to a heart attack.Myocardial infarction is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. The symptoms of a heart attack include chest pain, discomfort in the back, sweating, nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath. In case of a suspected heart attack, the person should be given aspirin and rushed to a hospital immediately. One should not wait for symptoms to settle. The earlier the person is rushed to the hospital, the better are the chances of survival.A heart attack can be treated with medications and in some cases, surgery might be required.

But this is not true. In reality, heart failure is a condition in which the heart fails to pump blood to the body as efficiently as it should.To put it technically, heart failure is a complex condition that impairs the ability of the lower chambers of the heart (called ventricles) to eject blood due to an underlying structural or functional heart problem. The condition develops over time as the heart muscles become weaker or stiffer, which ultimately affects the pumping capacity of the heart.While the risk of suffering from heart failure increases with age, there are certain factors that can put you at risk even at a young age. These include having a high BMI (body mass index), unhealthy choices such as smoking, sedentary lifestyle, consuming a diet high in saturated and trans fats as well as diseases that damage your heart.There are various treatment options that can help in heart failure and many people with heart failure live active lives. Medications for heart failure aim to manage the symptoms, improve the quality of life as well as increase the lifespan.

As a result, a large number of hypertension cases go undetected. However, patients can experience symptoms such as severe headache, fatigue, dizziness, chest pain, difficulty in breathing, etc.Once diagnosed with hypertension, you need to take proper measures to keep your blood pressure under control. These steps mostly focus on strict diet control, routine exercise/workouts, weight control, active lifestyle and stress management.

    "description about disease": "Calcium is vital for many important bodily functions like nerve transmission, bone structure, signaling between cells, and blood coagulation. Most of the body's calcium is stored in bones, although some of it circulates in the blood. About 40% of the calcium in blood is bound to proteins in blood, mainly albumin. Protein-bound calcium acts as a reserve of calcium for the cells but has no active role in the body. Only unbound calcium influences the body\u2019s functions. Unbound calcium has an electrical (ionic) charge, so it is also known as ionized calcium. Thus, hypocalcemia causes complications only when the level of ionized calcium is low.Hypocalcemia or low levels of calcium occurs when a total serum calcium concentration is < 8.8 mg/dL (< 2.20 mmol/L) in the presence of normal plasma protein concentrations or a serum ionized calcium concentration < 4.7 mg/dL (< 1.17 mmol/L).Calcium levels are regulated by hormones like a parathyroid hormone (PTH), Vitamin D, and calcitonin. Hypocalcemia is most commonly a consequence of Vitamin D inadequacy or hypoparathyroidism, or a resistance to these hormones and it has also been associated with many drugs as well.Hypocalcemia can range from being asymptomatic in mild cases to life-threatening in acute cases. Manifestations include paresthesias, tetany, and, when severe, seizures, encephalopathy, andheart failure.Diagnosis of hypocalcemia involves measurement of serum calcium with adjustment for serum albumin concentration.

Epidemics of flu happen annually during autumn and winter in temperate areas and produce significant mortality and morbidity each year.The virus is transmitted from person to person with respiratory droplets produced when the patient coughs or sneezes within close contact (<1 m). Individuals usually recover after a few days, but influenza can give rise to complications, especially in high-risk groups like pregnant women, individuals with an underlying immunodeficiency state, adults older than 65 years of age, children below 5 years, and individuals with chronic diseases likeasthma, heart and kidney conditions.The symptoms of flu include high fever,body ache,headache, severe malaise, dry cough,sore throat, and runny nose. It should be differentiated from thecommon coldby clinical presentations. Flu also shares some of its symptoms with COVID -19 infection. One cannot tell the difference between flu and COVID-19 just by looking at the symptoms, hence, testing is needed to confirm the diagnosis. Testing is also important as it can determine if someone is suffering from both flu and COVID-19 at the same time.Treatment of flu involves relieving the symptoms and in some cases, the use of antiviral drugs is also required.

It primarily affects children between the ages of 0 to 15 years and occasionally adults.Most people infected with JE do not have symptoms or have only mild symptoms and treatment involves supporting the functions of the body as it tries to fight off the infection.However, a small percentage of infected people can develop inflammation of the brain (encephalitis), with symptoms like sudden onset ofheadache, high fever, disorientation, coma, tremors and convulsions.The prevention generally consists of avoiding mosquito bites by using mosquito repellents, wearing long-sleeved shirts and long pants, getting vaccinated for JE is also important especially while living in or traveling to JE endemic areas.",

    "title": "Jaundice",
    "description about disease": "Jaundice is a condition characterized by yellowish discoloration of the skin, sclera (whites of the eyes), and mucous membranes resulting from the accumulation of excessive amounts of bilirubin. Bilirubin is a waste product that is made during the normal breakdown of hemoglobin. It passes through the liver and is eventually excreted from the body. Excessive bilirubin is the result of increased production or impaired excretion.The normal serum levels of bilirubin are less than 1mg/dl; however, peripheral yellowing of the eye sclera (also known as icterus), is seen when the bilirubin levels are as high as 3 mg/dl as sclerae have a high affinity for bilirubin due to their high elastin content. As the serum bilirubin levels increase, the skin will progressively discolor ranging from yellow to green. The green color is due to biliverdin, a type of bile pigment that gives the color.Jaundice usually does not require treatment in adults. Treatment if required is mostly focussed on its underlying causes and complications. Jaundice can generally be managed with diet or lifestyle, but if the cause is severe, the individuals may need immediate surgical or long-term treatment.",

Other symptoms may include blood in the urine, nausea, vomiting, foul-smelling urine, and frequent need to urinate.Factors including dehydration, family history of kidney stones, obesity, and diet with high levels of protein and salt predispose to the formation of kidney stones.Adequate hydration is a key preventive measure for kidney stones, which ensures that most kidney stones pass out via urine on their own with time.

Leprosy is known to develop slowly and can take from six months to 40 years to show any symptoms.Leprosy is mildly contagious and not highly transmissible. The exact mechanism of transmission is not fully understood. The bacteria is most likely transmitted via droplets, from the nose and mouth, during prolonged, close and frequent contact with untreated cases. Although human-to-human transmission is the primary source of infection, certain animals can carry and rarely transfer M. leprae to humans. These include nine-banded armadillos, African chimpanzee, sooty mangabey, and cynomolgus macaque.Even though the risk of contracting leprosy is quite low, one can reduce the risk by avoiding contact with body fluids and the rashes of people who have leprosy. Diagnosis of the condition is based on clinical symptoms and is confirmed by biopsy. Leprosy is curable with multidrug therapy (MDT). Majority of patients can take their medications at home and continue with their regular lives. Patients rapidly become non contagious after starting therapy and do not need to be isolated.",

Unlike hypertension (high blood pressure), hypotension receives less attention but is equally important for overall health. Various factors can lead to hypotension, including dehydration, certain medications, and underlying medical conditions such as heart problems or neurological disorders. Age can also play a role, with older adults being more susceptible to sudden drops in blood pressure, especially when standing up (orthostatic hypotension).Hypotension is a blood pressure reading consistently below 90/60mmHg (millimetres of mercury). While many people with low blood pressure experience no symptoms, others may suffer from dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting, or blurred vision. These symptoms can significantly impact daily life and overall well-being.To manage hypotension, it's essential to identify the underlying cause. Treatment options may include lifestyle changes such as increasing fluid and salt intake, adjusting medications, and addressing specific health issues. In some cases, compression stockings or medications might be recommended to help maintain blood pressure levels.Ignoring hypotension can lead to complications, particularly if it results in frequent falls or injuries from fainting. Therefore, recognizing the symptoms and seeking appropriate treatment is crucial for maintaining a healthy and active lifestyle.",

Some of the common symptoms include weight loss, bone pain,nausea, frequent infections, fatigue, confusion and loss of appetite.The treatment of multiple myeloma is aimed at decreasing the severity of symptoms and slowing down its progress. Treatment involves medications, stem cell transplants, bisphosphonate therapy, platelet transfusions, and/or plasmapheresis.",

In MS, the protective sheath covering the nerves called myelin gets destroyed, which disrupts the communication between the brain and the rest of the body.MS generally strikes people at an age between 20 to 45 years. Women are twice more likely to develop this condition as compared to men.Some common symptoms of the disease include muscle weakness (often in the hands and legs), tingling, burning sensations, numbness, chronic pain, coordination and balance issues, fatigue, dizziness, vision problems, slurred speech, and difficulty with bladder control.Management includes medications for slowing the progression of the disease and managing its symptoms.",

People affected with mumps display symptoms such asheadache, fever,tiredness, loss of appetite, and muscle aches. However, swollen parotid and other salivary glands are the hallmark symptom of mumps. This causes a tender and sensitive jaw and puffy cheeks.Mumps is a self-resolving illness that simply runs its course. Patients are given supportive care treatment to manage symptoms associated with mumps. Rest, painkillers (exceptaspirin), adequate fluid intake and avoidance of sour and acidic foods help in recovery. Use of warm and cold compresses can provide relief from swollen and tender salivary glands.The MMR vaccine is the mainstay for preventing the occurrence of mumps. This vaccine protects people against three diseases:measles, mumps, and rubella. This vaccine is safe in nature and works as an extremely effective prevention strategy.The prognosis for a patient with mumps is good. Most children with mumps recover fully in about 2 weeks. Usually, adults are able to go back to work a week or ten days after being infected with mumps. Complications from mumps are rare, but can be serious, if left untreated.",

It refers to a condition which causes marked softening of the bones due to a decreased ability to harden or mineralize.Bones are made up of various minerals, including calcium and phosphorus, that give structure and integrity to the bones. Vitamin D controls levels of calcium and phosphorus in the body. An imbalance of these minerals which usually occurs due to deficiency of Vitamin D can interfere with bone health and can cause an individual to develop osteomalacia.Osteomalacia can cause bone pain, muscle weakness, difficulty in walking, and an increased susceptibility to bone fractures. This condition is mostly seen in adults. In children, it is referred to asrickets, which causes impaired mineralization at the bone growth plate. This results in softening and deformation of bones in children and limits their growth. Osteomalacia is different from osteoporosis. Though both can cause bones to fracture, osteomalacia is a problem with bones not hardening, while osteoporosis is the weakening of living bone caused when balance between bone loss and bone formation is disrupted.Treatment for osteomalacia involves providing adequate Vitamin D and calcium, both of which are required to harden and strengthen bones, and treating the causing disorders.",

It is transmitted only from person to person through the fecal-oral route or, less frequently, by contaminated water or food.Signs and symptoms of polio range from no symptoms to limb deformities, paralysis, and even death.Not receiving the polio vaccine, weak immunity, and travel to areas endemic to the disease are the main risk factors for getting infected with poliovirus.Diagnosis of polio is based on the patient's history, physical exam, and symptoms. The virus may be isolated from the patient's throat, feces, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)\u00a0 to confirm the diagnosis.There is no cure for polio. Treatment of polio is mainly supportive and focuses on limiting and alleviating symptoms.For most patients, the prognosis is good because there are few or no symptoms; however, the prognosis is severely limited if the patient develops more severe symptoms such as limb deformity, paralysis, difficulty breathing, and inability to swallow foods.Polio can only be prevented by immunization. The vaccine, given multiple times, can protect a child for life. Due to the launch of a few initiatives like Global Polio Eradication, more than 18 million people who would otherwise have been paralyzed can walk today.",

However, some women suffering from PCOS do not develop cysts, while some women not having this disease might develop cysts due to some other conditions.The exact PCOS causes are not known yet. However, it has been observed that most women with PCOS have insulin resistance. Another factor that can affect the occurrence of PCOS isobesity, as it can result in high levels of inflammation in the body, leading to higher levels of androgen. PCOS is also mostly thought to be hereditary, running through the genes, into different generations.Women suffering from this condition may experience irregular menstrual cycles, excess growth of facial hair, hair thinning,acne, and sleep disorder. PCOS can also increase the riskhypertension, high cholesterol,diabetes, heart diseases, and endometrial cancer.The symptoms of PCOS are manageable under proper medical guidance. Medications that regulate the menstrual cycle can help to ovulate, reduce hair growth and also help to manage other PCOS symptoms. Along with the help of a nutritious diet, a healthy lifestyle, and regular exercising, one can maintain healthy blood glucose levels and a healthy weight.

Some of the first signs of pre-eclampsia are high blood pressure, protein in the urine, and sudden swelling of the faces, hands and feet.The exact cause of pre-eclampsia isn't fully understood, but it's thought to be associated with placental issues and risk factors like advanced maternal age, prior history of the condition, multiple pregnancies (e.g., twins), and certain health conditions.For those at risk, steps like gaining a healthy amount of weight, managing blood pressure and blood sugar levels, along with low dose aspirin can help reduce the chances of pre-eclampsia during pregnancy.The cure for pre-eclampsia is delivery of the baby. If the baby is not close to term, the mother will be monitored regularly. Bed rest at home or hospital will be advised depending on the severity of pre-eclampsia. Medications to manage hypertension, prevent seizures and promote the baby\u2019s lung maturity will be administered.Most women who develop pre-eclampsia deliver healthy babies and do not have any further complications.

However, certain factors like history of preterm labor, less interval between consecutive pregnancies, being pregnant with more than one baby, smoking and certain medical conditions like urinary tract infections(UTIs), diabetes and high blood pressure can increase the risk of preterm labor.Growth happens throughout the pregnancy including the final months and weeks. For example, the brain, lungs, and liver need the final weeks of pregnancy to develop completely. Hence, doctors usually try to delay or stop preterm labor to let the pregnancy continue.Prematurely delivered babies have a higher risk of health complications.

It is estimated that about200 million peoplesuffer from scabies worldwide at any given time and upto 10% of children from poor economic backgrounds tend to be affected by it. Scabies is a highly contagious disease that spreads through prolonged and close physical contact with an infected patient.Scabies outbreaks are more commonly seen in crowded places such as nursing institutions, daycare centers, prisons, etc., where people live in close proximity to each other. The symptoms of scabies range from a severe itching sensation to the formation of skin lesions such as burrows, papules, crusts, etc. The urge to itch may be especially strong at night.Scabies is contagious and can spread quickly through close physical contact. Since scabies is a contagious disease , physicians often recommend treatment for entire families or contact groups. Scabies is treated with topical application of anti-scabies creams or lotions. Oral tablets might be required in some cases. It is recommended to simultaneously treat all members living in close proximity to the patient to prevent reinfection.",

    "description about disease": "Sciatica is a serious condition that results from pressure on the sciatic nerve, the largest nerve in the human body, formed by the union of 5 nerves from the lower part of the spine. The most common cause of sciatica is related to discs like disc herniation or bony overgrowths. Causes not related to the disc may include cancer, infections, or compression of the blood vessels.Individuals with sciatica experience pain, numbness, pricking or stabbing sensation, and muscle weakness in the sciatic nerve distribution. Sciatica pain often is worsened by twisting, bending, or coughing. Sciatica may be triggered by improper posture, too long standing or sitting in the same place, obesity, and increased height.This condition is usually seen in older adults. Women are more commonly affected by men. Severe injury to the nerve can cause a drop foot effect, i.e. difficulty lifting the front part of the foot. Other complications may include loss of bowel and bladder control.Treatment generally varies depending on the severity and cause of the condition. Various management protocols include conservative treatment like staying active, painkillers, acupuncture, epidural steroid injections, spinal manipulation, and physical therapy.

According to a survey byThe National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), an estimated 134 million Indians suffer from chronic sinusitis. These numbers are surprisingly double the number of people with diabetes in India.The human body has four pairs of sinuses. In a healthy person, each sinus is lined by a membrane that produces mucus. This is a thin, watery fluid that flows freely from the sinuses into the upper part of your nose. However, when sinuses get inflamed by some viral, bacterial infection, allergens or irritants, the mucus gets thick and sticky and cannot flow into the nose. This results in fluid build up in the sinuses, causing pressure, pain and other symptoms.Home care tips like application of warm compress on your face, use of saline nasal drops, maintaining adequate hydration of the body, steam inhalation and use of a humidifier can provide great relief from symptoms of sinusitis. In case of severe or prolonged symptoms, it is always advisable to visit a doctor for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.

With age, these discs can weaken due to a loss of water content, leading to a herniated disc, often occurring in the lower back (lumbar spine).When a disc herniates, it can press on nearby spinal nerves, causing symptoms like leg pain, numbness, tingling, or weakness, commonly referred to as sciatica. Sciatica typically affects people between the ages of 30 and 50.Most cases of herniated discs improve with nonsurgical treatments, with 80-90% of patients finding relief within a few weeks. Surgery is considered if pain persists and interferes with daily activities, with over 90% success in relieving leg pain, though it is less effective for back pain.

Sunburn serves as a clear indication of skin damage and escalates the risk of developing skin cancer.Appropriate measures of sun protection, such as avoiding sun or seeking shade, particularly during peak sun hours (10 a.m. to 4 p.m.), wearing protective clothing and wide-brimmed hats, and using a broad-spectrum sunscreen with a high sun protection factor (SPF), can significantly decrease the likelihood of getting sunburned.Keep in mind that sunburn can occur even on overcast days, as UV radiation can permeate cloud cover and reflect off surfaces. Therefore, it is vital to remain vigilant and take precautions whenever you are exposed to the sun. Nurturing and protecting your skin today will guarantee a healthier and happier skin in the future.",

In primary syphilis, symptoms appear after 10 days to three months after one has been exposed to infection. The first sign is a small painless sore called a chancre found on the genitals, rectum, or mouth. In secondary syphilis, the chancre disappears but the rash spreads from the trunk to the whole body. The last stage is tertiary syphilis which begins after years of an initial infection. Some complications of syphilis are numbness, blindness, paralysis, and heart disease.Syphilis can be prevented by having safe sex, avoiding multiple sexual partners and promoting sex education. Syphilis is mainly treated with antibiotic therapy such aspenicillin G. However, in cases of penicillin allergy, penicillin desensitization or use of other medications likedoxycycline,tetracyclineorceftriaxoneis recommended.",

The testicles are responsible for producing the sperm and male sex hormones.Testicular cancer is rare in occurrence when compared to other cancers. Testicular cancer accounts for merely 1% of malignancies found in men. It can occur in men of all ages but it is most commonly seen in the age group of 15 to 44 years. It usually affects only one testicle.Testicular cancer is fairly treatable and can be cured when detected early. Depending on your exact diagnosis and staging of cancer, your doctor can advise you surveillance, surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy.

It is a condition in which a person has less than the usual amount of hemoglobin (an oxygen-carrying protein) in their body.The primary cause of thalassemia is a mutation in the DNA of the cells that limit the production of alpha or beta chains in the hemoglobin. Depending on which chain is affected, two types of thalassemia may arise - alpha thalassemia or beta-thalassemia. Thalassemia may also be characterized on the basis of its severity. A person with mild symptoms of thalassemia is known to have thalassemia minor. However, a person with moderate or severe symptoms may be considered as thalassemia major. A person may also be a carrier of thalassemia even if they do not show any symptoms of the disease.For people with a thalassemia minor, regular screening and intake of necessary supplements may be enough. However, people with thalassemia major may require frequent blood transfusions or bone marrow transplants.Although a genetic disease, thalassemia can be prevented in a child by the parents undergoing specific blood tests before conceiving giving birth.

Platelets are blood cells that help in blood clotting by clumping together and plugging the injury site hence, stopping bleeding.Patients with thrombocytopenia show easy or excessive bleeding, blood in the urine or stools, extreme fatigue, and prolonged bleeding from a wound site. Various causes of thrombocytopenia are medical conditions that lead to increased platelet destruction, decreased platelet production, increased trapping of platelets or dilution of blood.The treatment for thrombocytopenia depends on the severity of the condition. Generally, mild cases of low platelet count go undiagnosed and may not require any specific treatment. In such cases, your doctor may hold off treatment and simply monitor you for some time. In case of severe symptoms, patients are usually prescribed corticosteroids, other medications, or platelet transfusions. Splenectomy or removal of spleen is usually the last line of treatment and is advised when medications fail to treat low platelet count effectively.",

    "causes of disease": "['Increased platelet destruction', 'Decreased platelet production', 'Increased sequestration or trapping of platelets', 'Dilution of blood', \"Autoimmune diseases:In autoimmune diseases, the body's immune system starts to attack healthy cells of the body. One example of this type of autoimmune disease is immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). In ITP, the immune system attacks and destroys its own platelets. The exact cause of this condition is not known. Other autoimmune diseases such as antiphospholipid syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis and sarcoidosis can also cause thrombocytopenia.\", \"Medications:Certain medications such asheparin(anticoagulant medication that prevents clot formation),quinineandvalproic acidcan sometimes trigger the immune system and result in the formation of anti-platelet antibodies that attack the body's own platelets. Sulfa containing antibiotics and anticonvulsants are some other medications that can cause thrombocytopenia.\", 'Infections:Bacterial infections such as Helicobacter pylori infections, leptospirosis, brucellosis and anaplasmosis can result in low platelet count. Chronic viral infections like hepatitis C andHIVanti-platelets antibodies are present which cause platelet destruction.', 'Surgery:Platelets can get destroyed when they pass through artificial heart valves, blood vessel grafts, or machines and tubes used for blood transfusions or bypass surgery.', 'Pregnancy:During pregnancy, some women develop a mild to moderate form of thrombocytopenia when they are close to delivering a baby. Thrombocytopenia during the third trimester is usually mild and resolves soon after delivery. Doctors may continue to monitor platelet count through the remaining pregnancy to prevent the number from dropping further.', 'Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP):It is a rare blood disorder in which blood clots start developing in small blood vessels in the body. These clots reduce the number of circulating platelets and result in thrombocytopenia.', \"Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC):It is a rare complication of pregnancy, severe infections, or severe trauma. In this condition, the blood clots form suddenly throughout the body that use up many of the blood's platelets.\", 'Hemolysis, elevated liver tests, low platelets (HELLP) syndrome:It is another non-immune thrombocytopenia that may occur during pregnancy.', 'Hemolytic uremic syndrome:It is a rare disorder caused by shiga toxin-producing organisms (E. coli and Shigella) that leads to a decline in the number of platelets.', 'Cancers:Leukaemia (blood cancer), lymphoma and myelodysplastic syndromes cause uncontrollable growth of abnormal cells in the bone marrow. These abnormal cells crowd out the healthy cells that are typically present in the bone marrow, including platelets. Thrombocytopenia is a widespread and early presentation in patients with acute leukaemia. Patients who have cancer can also experience low platelet count as a side effect of chemotherapy.', 'Bone marrow failure:It is seen in aplastic anemia and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria which can cause severe reduction in platelet count. Aplastic anemia is a rare condition in which the body stops producing new blood cells. Such individuals often develop a low platelet count and deficiency of red and white blood cells. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria is closely related to aplastic anemia.', 'Chronic alcoholism:Thrombocytopenia is commonly seen in heavy drinkers since alcohol exposure slows down the production of megakaryocytes, large bone marrow cells that are responsible for producing platelets.', 'Viral infections:Infections caused by varicella-zoster virus, cytomegalovirus, epstein-barr virus, mumps virus, parvovirus B19, rickettsia, rubella virus, zika virus, hepatitis C virus andHIVcan cause reduced platelet production.', 'Nutritional deficiencies:Lack of Vitamin B12, folate and copper can cause low platelet production.', 'Toxic chemicals:Exposure to toxic chemicals such as arsenic, benzene, and pesticides can affect the normal production of platelets.', 'Cirrhosis or scarring of liver:It causes reduced production of thrombopoietin, a hormone which regulates the production of platelets. This leads to reduced production of platelets by the bone marrow.', 'Congenital conditions:Conditions like Fanconi anemia, gray platelet syndrome, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, Alport syndrome, Bernard-Soulier syndrome, platelet-type or pseudo\u2013von Willebrand disease, May-Hegglin syndromes, and Shwachman-Diamond syndrome.', 'Medications:Over-the-counter medicine such asaspirinoribuprofencan affect production of platelets.

However, due to stress and an inactive lifestyle, even people in their 20s are also at a high risk of diabetes.Initially, Type 2 diabetes is mostly asymptomatic. Also, the symptoms tend to develop slowly and go unnoticed for a long time which makes it difficult to diagnose the condition. You might be at a higher risk of type 2 diabetes if anyone in your family has diabetes along with other risk factors such as obesity, inactive lifestyle, etc.The gold standard test to diagnose type 2 diabetes is HbA1c as it gives you an idea of your blood glucose levels over the past 3 months. However, other tests such as fasting glucose and postprandial glucose tests are also commonly used. Once diagnosed, it is important to go for regular health check-ups and manage your diabetes properly because if left uncontrolled, it can impact other organs such as the kidneys, eyes, heart, nerves and legs.Type 2 diabetes is managed with the help of diet control, exercise and use of oral medications.

    "description about disease": "Urticaria is a condition characterized by itchy skin, reddened areas with defined borders, and swelling of the skin. It can be classified as acute or chronic based on the duration. Acute urticaria usually stays for 6 weeks while chronic urticaria may stay over 6 weeks. In most cases, chronic urticaria can recur frequently over weeks and months.The most common causes of acute urticaria are allergic reactions to food, medicine, cosmetics or soap, infections, insect bites or stings, environmental pollutants, latex, extreme temperatures, emotional stress, and exercise. The cause of chronic urticaria is often difficult to identify and many times, impossible. However, in some cases, chronic urticaria can be linked to the conditions affecting the immune system or to diseases like hepatitis or cancer.Urticaria can be mistaken for other skin conditions with similar appearance. However, a dermatologist can help to differentiate and diagnose the condition based on the symptoms, medical history and skin examination.Urticaria can be prevented by avoiding exposure to any known causes, triggers or allergens. There is no specific treatment for urticaria as in most cases, the symptoms usually subside within a few days. In some cases, use of home remedies can help improve the symptoms like pain, swelling, and itching. If hives are caused by an allergy, then use of antihistamines might be advised.

They may appear as swollen, twisted clusters of blue or purple veins. These occur because standing and walking increases the pressure in the veins of the lower body.Varicose can appear anywhere, but most often appear on the legs, in the pelvic area, and on the surface of the skin. Mild cases of varicose veins just produce leg discomfort and may just look aesthetically unpleasing but the severe form can lead to pain, swelling, itching bleeding, and eventually ulcer formation.Older women are at a higher risk of developing varicose veins due to hormonal changes and loss of elasticity of the vein walls. Other risk factors can include prolonged standing or sitting, family history, and trauma.Treatment might involve conservative or surgical management. Conservative management comprises self-care measures and compression therapy. Surgical or minimally invasive procedures are done by a healthcare provider to close or remove veins.",
